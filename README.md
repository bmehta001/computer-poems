# computer-poems
This is the github repository accompanying the Kindle book computer poems by Bhagirath Mehta. 

Feel free to download these poems and run them on your computer and see what sorts of cool output you get! 

If you have prior coding experience, I would encourage you to change the code and make these poems your own! If you don't have coding experience, you can try modifying the text in the txt files to other famous literature or poems, for example, so the poems made are scraped out of different texts. Feel free to email me at bpmerudite@hotmail.com if you have any questions or would like to share your poems with me.

Two last notes: 

1) Make sure to write python3 -m pip install (package name) in the terminal substituting the package name )These are the import statements on top of the python .py files) with the library you would like to install (nltk, etc.) if you don't have the package pre-installed. 

2) If you do not get any output or a land an error during the first run of the program, make sure to run it multiple times. Even with the text I provided, there are times that the words may not fulfill some existing conditions of my program or the packages that I have used for the program. Because of this, you may not get any output or land an error. If you are not getting anything because you have changed the text in the txt files, for example, perhaps try using other text or changing the code in the files to "fit" the constraints of the text.

I hope you enjoy these computer poems! Cheers!
